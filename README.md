# Swap Emacs windows with their neighbours

If you enjoy using `windmove`, this package is an add-on for you: it
has variants of the `windmove` commands which swap the buffers as you
move, so that you get the effect of "dragging" windows around
directionally with the arrow keys.

_Update: as of Emacs 27.1, there are `windmove-swap-*` commands that
are mostly identical to this package, with the exception that they
will happily swap the contents of dedicated windows, while `windswap`
refuses to do so: this seems like a better behaviour to me._

## Installation

You can install `windswap` from the
[MELPA](http://melpa.org) repository. The version of
`windswap` there will always be up-to-date.

Add global key bindings for `windswap`'s commands manually, or use the
convenient `windswap-default-keybindings` function.

```elisp
(windmove-default-keybindings 'control)
(windswap-default-keybindings 'control 'shift)
```
